# Enable branch protection rules on the `master` branch for
# obsidian-steady-links.  Run this after: gh auth login
#
# Requires: gh (GitHub CLI) with write access to the repo.
#
# Scoring impact (OpenSSF Scorecard v5):
#   Tier 1 (3/10): prevent force pushes, prevent branch deletion  -- INCLUDED
#   Tier 2 (6/10): require PR, require 1 approval                 -- INCLUDED
#   Tier 3 (8/10): require status checks to pass                  -- INCLUDED
#
# Admin bypass: administrators are NOT required to use PRs, so
# you can still direct-push or force-push when needed.
#
# Usage:
#   gh auth login   (if not already done)
#   pwsh .github/enable-branch-protection.ps1
